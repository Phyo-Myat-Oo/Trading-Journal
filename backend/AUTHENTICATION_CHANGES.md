# Authentication Middleware Standardization

## Overview

This project standardizes on the modern `authenticate` middleware from `authMiddleware.ts`, removing the legacy `authenticateToken` middleware from `auth.ts`. This change resolves authentication inconsistencies and improves security across the application.

## Changes Made

1. Replaced the legacy `authenticateToken` middleware with the modern `authenticate` middleware in all route files:
   - `journalRoutes.ts`
   - `accountRoutes.ts`
   - `analysisRoutes.ts`
   - `statisticsRoutes.ts`
   - `scheduledJobsRoutes.ts`
   - `userRoutes.ts` (previously updated)

2. Removed duplicate authentication in `routes/index.ts` to avoid double authentication:
   ```javascript
   // Before
   router.use('/api/trades', authenticate, tradeRoutes);
   
   // After
   router.use('/api/trades', tradeRoutes);
   ```

3. Removed the legacy `auth.ts` file after confirming it was no longer imported anywhere

4. Updated the TypeScript interface for Request in `express.d.ts` to standardize the user object type:
   ```typescript
   // Before
   interface Request {
     user?: IUser | { id: string };
   }
   
   // After
   interface Request {
     user?: IUser;
   }
   ```

## Security Improvements

The modern `authenticate` middleware provides several security enhancements:

1. **JWT ID (jti) Support**: Each token has a unique identifier that can be used for blacklisting
2. **Token Blacklisting**: Revoked tokens are tracked in a database
3. **Audience Validation**: Tokens must have the correct audience claim
4. **Token Type Validation**: Ensures access tokens are used for API access, not refresh tokens
5. **Password Change Detection**: Invalidates tokens issued before a password change

## Testing

A comprehensive testing plan has been created in `AUTHENTICATION_TESTING.md` to verify these changes. This includes:

1. Unit tests
2. Manual route testing
3. Security testing
4. Role-based access control testing

## Testing Strategy

### Comprehensive Testing Plan

A detailed testing plan was created in `AUTHENTICATION_TESTING.md` to verify that all routes are properly secured with the modern authentication middleware.

### Automated Test Scripts

To facilitate testing, we've created two Node.js scripts:

1. `test-auth.js` - Tests access to admin routes with authentication
2. `test-user-route.js` - Tests user profile access and admin-only endpoints

These scripts use axios to authenticate with the API and test protected endpoints. Detailed instructions for running these tests are available in `AUTH_TEST_INSTRUCTIONS.md`.

### Verification Process

The authentication system has been verified through:

1. Manual testing of endpoints with and without authentication tokens
2. Checking for appropriate 401 Unauthorized responses on unauthenticated requests
3. Verifying proper user information attachment to requests
4. Ensuring role-based access controls are functioning correctly

## Future Considerations

1. Consider implementing token rotation for enhanced security
2. Monitor authentication failures for potential security incidents
3. Consider adding IP-based restrictions for sensitive operations
4. Consider implementing refresh token rotation for enhanced security
5. Add rate limiting to authentication endpoints to prevent brute force attacks
6. Implement stronger password policies
7. Consider adding 2FA support
