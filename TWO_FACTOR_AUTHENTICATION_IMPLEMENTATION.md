# Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of two-factor authentication (2FA) in the Trading Journal application. The 2FA system uses Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) for verification, compatible with authenticator apps like Google Authenticator, Authy, and Microsoft Authenticator.

## Overview

The implementation consists of:

1. **Backend components** (pre-existing):
   - User model with 2FA fields
   - Controllers for 2FA verification and management
   - Services for generating secrets and QR codes
   - Routes for 2FA operations

2. **Frontend components** (newly implemented):
   - 2FA verification during login
   - 2FA setup in security settings
   - Security management UI

## Implementation Details

### Backend Structure

- `twoFactorController.ts`: Handles 2FA verification, setup, and management
- `twoFactorService.ts`: Provides utilities for TOTP and backup codes
- User model: Includes fields for 2FA status, secrets, and backup codes
- Routes: Endpoints for 2FA verification, setup, and management

### Frontend Components

#### Login Flow with 2FA

1. User enters email and password
2. If 2FA is enabled, the backend returns `requireTwoFactor: true`
3. Frontend displays `TwoFactorVerify` component for code entry
4. User enters code from authenticator app or backup code
5. On successful verification, user is logged in

#### Security Settings

1. `SecuritySettings` page shows account security options
2. `AccountSecurity` component displays 2FA status and options
3. `TwoFactorSetup` component provides step-by-step 2FA setup:
   - QR code scanning
   - Manual secret entry
   - Verification code confirmation
   - Backup codes management

### Services and Contexts

- `authService.ts`: Extended with 2FA verification methods
- `userService.ts`: Added methods for 2FA management
- `AuthContext.tsx`: Updated to handle 2FA verification flow

## Usage Flow

### Setting Up 2FA

1. Navigate to Security Settings
2. Click "Enable" under Two-Factor Authentication
3. Scan QR code with authenticator app
4. Enter verification code to confirm setup
5. Save backup codes securely

### Login with 2FA

1. Enter email and password
2. When prompted, enter 6-digit code from authenticator app
3. If authenticator app is unavailable, use a backup code

### Disabling 2FA

1. Navigate to Security Settings
2. Click "Disable" under Two-Factor Authentication
3. Enter password to confirm

## Technical Considerations

- TOTP implementation uses the industry-standard 30-second window
- Backup codes are single-use and automatically invalidated after use
- React context provides centralized authentication state management
- Security settings include password confirmation for sensitive actions

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. Create a test user and enable 2FA
2. Scan QR code with an authenticator app
3. Confirm the setup with a verification code
4. Log out and log back in to verify the 2FA flow
5. Test backup code functionality
6. Verify that disabling 2FA works correctly

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements:

1. Email notifications for 2FA changes
2. Recovery options beyond backup codes
3. Device remembering (trusted devices)
4. Push notification-based 2FA
5. U2F/WebAuthn support (hardware keys)
