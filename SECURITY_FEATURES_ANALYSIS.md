# Security Features Analysis for Trading Journal Application

## Implemented Security Features

### 1. Authentication System
- **JWT-based authentication** with access tokens and refresh tokens
- **Token Family Tracking** for refresh tokens to prevent replay attacks
- **Absolute Token Expiration** (7-day maximum validity)
- **Suspicious Pattern Detection** for potential token theft
- **Rate Limiting** on authentication endpoints to prevent brute force attacks

### 2. Account Protection
- **Account Lockout** after multiple failed login attempts
- **Admin Unlock** capability for locked accounts through admin panel
- **IP Address Tracking** for login attempts and token usage

### 3. Password Security
- **Secure Password Storage** with password hashing
- **Password Reset** functionality via email
- **Password Policy Enforcement** for strong passwords

### 4. Auditing and Logging
- **TokenEvent Model** for tracking security-related token events
- **AdminActivityLog** for tracking admin actions
- **Comprehensive Event Types** for monitoring security issues

### 5. Authorization
- **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)** with user and admin roles
- **Protected Routes** with middleware authentication checks
- **Granular Permissions** for different API endpoints

### 6. Session Management
- **Token Refresh Mechanism** with periodic checks (every 5 minutes)
- **Automatic Session Termination** on token expiration
- **Logout Functionality** that clears tokens

## Missing or Incomplete Security Features

### 1. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
- Not implemented in the current codebase
- No traces of 2FA-related code in authentication flows

### 2. Email Verification
- Present but limited implementation for account registration
- Verification needed flag exists but full flow appears incomplete

### 3. Remember Me Functionality
- UI element exists in the login form, but no backend implementation
- The checkbox appears on the login page but has no actual functionality

### 4. Social Authentication
- No implementation of OAuth or social login options
- No integration with providers like Google, GitHub, Facebook, etc.

### 5. Password Strength Indicator
- No client-side password strength indicators found in the registration form
- Missing real-time feedback for users creating passwords

### 6. CAPTCHA Protection
- No implementation of CAPTCHA or similar challenges for login forms
- Could help prevent automated attacks

## Recommendations for Enhancement

1. **Implement 2FA support** using TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) or SMS verification
2. **Complete email verification flow** for new accounts with proper email templates
3. **Add support for social authentication** to improve user experience and security
4. **Implement Remember Me functionality** with secure persistent tokens
5. **Add password strength indicators** for real-time feedback during registration
6. **Include CAPTCHA protection** for login and registration forms
7. **Enhance security headers** across the application
8. **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)** to prevent XSS attacks
9. **Conduct regular security audits** of the codebase and dependencies
10. **Add automated security testing** to the CI/CD pipeline
