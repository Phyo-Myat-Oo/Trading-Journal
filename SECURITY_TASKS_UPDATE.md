# Security Tasks Implementation Progress

This document tracks the progress of implementing security features as defined in the SECURITY_TASKS_TODO.md file.

## Recently Completed Tasks

### 1. Token Refresh Mechanism ✅

**Status**: Fully Implemented

**Completed Tasks:**
- ✅ Completed the token refresh interceptor in `api.ts`
- ✅ Implemented the `TokenManager` functionality for token refreshing
- ✅ Added proper error handling for expired tokens
- ✅ Implemented automatic token refresh before expiration
- ✅ Integrated token refresh mechanism in the authentication flow

The TokenManager now properly handles token lifecycle, proactive refreshing, error handling, and cross-tab synchronization. It uses an event-based system to communicate token states across the application.

### 11. CSRF Protection ✅

**Status**: Fully Implemented

**Completed Tasks:**
- ✅ Ensured CSRF protection for all authenticated requests
- ✅ Implemented CSRF token validation in the frontend
- ✅ Added proper error handling for CSRF failures
- ✅ Implemented automatic CSRF token renewal
- ✅ Added comprehensive tests for CSRF protection

The CSRFManager now properly handles CSRF token lifecycle, automatic renewal, and cross-tab synchronization.

### 3. JWT Token Expiration Handling ✅

**Status**: Fully Implemented

**Completed Tasks:**
- ✅ Set appropriate expiration times for both access and refresh tokens
- ✅ Implemented proper expiration handling on the frontend
- ✅ Added graceful handling of expired tokens during user sessions
- ✅ Ensured token validation includes proper expiration checks
- ✅ Added clear user feedback when a session expires

The system now supports dynamic token expiration based on device type, user activity, and "Remember Me" preference. It also includes a user-friendly session expiration dialog with countdown timer and one-click extension.
