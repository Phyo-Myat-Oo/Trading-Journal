# Security Tasks Implementation Progress

This document tracks the progress of implementing security features as defined in the SECURITY_TASKS_TODO.md file.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Token Refresh Mechanism ‚úÖ

**Status**: Fully Implemented

**Completed Tasks:**
- ‚úÖ Completed the token refresh interceptor in `api.ts`
- ‚úÖ Implemented the `TokenManager` functionality for token refreshing
- ‚úÖ Added proper error handling for expired tokens
- ‚úÖ Implemented automatic token refresh before expiration
- ‚úÖ Integrated token refresh mechanism in the authentication flow

The TokenManager now properly handles token lifecycle, proactive refreshing, error handling, and cross-tab synchronization. It uses an event-based system to communicate token states across the application.

### 3. JWT Token Expiration Handling ‚úÖ

**Status**: Fully Implemented

**Completed Tasks:**
- ‚úÖ Set appropriate expiration times for both access and refresh tokens
- ‚úÖ Implemented proper expiration handling on the frontend
- ‚úÖ Added graceful handling of expired tokens during user sessions
- ‚úÖ Ensured token validation includes proper expiration checks
- ‚úÖ Added clear user feedback when a session expires

The system now supports dynamic token expiration based on device type, user activity, and "Remember Me" preference. It also includes a user-friendly session expiration dialog with countdown timer and one-click extension.

### 5. Email Verification ‚úÖ

**Status**: Fully Implemented

**Completed Tasks:**
- ‚úÖ Complete email verification for new user registrations
- ‚úÖ Add proper email templates for verification messages
- ‚úÖ Implement verification token expiration and renewal
- ‚úÖ Add clear user interface for verification status
- ‚úÖ Prevent certain actions until email is verified

The system now includes a fully functioning email verification flow with:
- An enhanced `EmailVerificationBanner` component that appears when a user needs to verify their email
- A dedicated `VerifyEmail` page with clear success/error feedback and countdown redirect
- The ability to resend verification emails directly from the login page
- Proper handling of verification status in the authentication process
- Backend support for token verification and renewal
- Error handling for invalid or expired verification tokens

### 11. CSRF Protection ‚úÖ

**Status**: Fully Implemented

**Completed Tasks:**
- ‚úÖ Ensured CSRF protection for all authenticated requests
- ‚úÖ Implemented CSRF token validation in the frontend
- ‚úÖ Added proper error handling for CSRF failures
- ‚úÖ Implemented automatic CSRF token renewal
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive tests for CSRF protection

The CSRFManager now properly handles CSRF token lifecycle, automatic renewal, and cross-tab synchronization.

### 12. Security Headers ‚úÖ

**Status**: Fully Implemented

**Completed Tasks:**
- ‚úÖ Implement Content-Security-Policy headers
- ‚úÖ Add X-XSS-Protection headers
- ‚úÖ Configure Referrer-Policy for all routes
- ‚úÖ Implement Feature-Policy/Permissions-Policy headers
- ‚úÖ Test security headers with security scanning tools

**Additional Enhancements:**
- ‚úÖ Enhanced CSP with environment-specific configurations
- ‚úÖ Added Cross-Origin Resource Policy
- ‚úÖ Added Cross-Origin Opener Policy
- ‚úÖ Added Cross-Origin Embedder Policy
- ‚úÖ Improved IP-based rate limiting independent of endpoints
- ‚úÖ Added Retry-After headers for rate limit responses

### Password Reset Bug Fix ‚úÖ

**Status**: Fixed

**Bug Details:**
There was a mismatch between how the password reset token was generated and stored. In the `requestPasswordReset` function, a JWT token was being sent to the user's email, but there was no code to properly store this JWT in the user's `resetPasswordToken` field.

**Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ Fixed the `requestPasswordReset` function in `authController.ts` to properly store the JWT token in the user document
- ‚úÖ Set an appropriate expiration time in the user document that matches the JWT expiration
- ‚úÖ Added proper TypeScript typing for error objects with response properties in the API service
- ‚úÖ Ensured consistent error handling between frontend and backend

This fix ensures that password reset tokens work correctly, and users can successfully reset their passwords using the email links.

## Mostly Completed Tasks

### 4. Account Lockout Enhancement üü°

**Status**: Mostly Completed (80-90%)

**Completed Tasks:**
- ‚úÖ Implemented progressive lockout times based on consecutive failures
  - First lockout: 15 minutes
  - Second lockout: 30 minutes
  - Third+ lockout: 60 minutes
  - After 3+ lockouts: Admin intervention required
- ‚úÖ Implemented notification emails for account lockouts
- ‚úÖ Created admin interface for managing locked accounts
- ‚úÖ Added audit logging for lockout events
- ‚úÖ Added account status badges to indicate lockout severity

**What's still needed:**
- Admin notification system for high-risk accounts could be enhanced
- Custom lockout timeframes were planned but not fully implemented

### 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) üü°

**Status**: Mostly Completed (75-85%)

**Completed Tasks:**
- ‚úÖ Implemented backend authorization middleware with role support
- ‚úÖ Created `RoleBasedRoute` component for frontend route protection
- ‚úÖ Added `useAuthorization` hook for permission checking
- ‚úÖ Implemented `RoleBasedPermissions` component for conditional rendering
- ‚úÖ Protected admin routes with proper role checks

**What's still needed:**
- The `useAuthorization` hook needs more fine-grained permission checks
- Some role-specific route protection needs enhancement
- Permission-based UI rendering could be more consistently applied

### 7. Session Management üü°

**Status**: Mostly Completed (70-80%)

**Completed Tasks:**
- ‚úÖ Implemented sessions management view in user settings
- ‚úÖ Added ability to view all active sessions with device details
- ‚úÖ Implemented functionality to terminate individual sessions
- ‚úÖ Added session refresh functionality
- ‚úÖ Implemented token family tracking

**What's still needed:**
- Enhanced session tracking with more detailed device/location information
- Detection for suspicious session activity could be improved
- Some planned enhancements haven't been completed

## Partially Completed Tasks

### 8. Security Audit Logging üü†

**Status**: Partially Completed (60-70%)

**Completed Tasks:**
- ‚úÖ Implemented token event logging (suspicious usage, revocation, refresh attempts)
- ‚úÖ Added admin activity logging (account management, user unlocking)
- ‚úÖ Implemented basic security event logging (failed logins, rate limit violations)

**What's still needed:**
- Admin interface for viewing comprehensive security logs needs enhancement
- Exportable reports functionality is missing or incomplete
- Advanced filtering and searching of security logs is not fully implemented
- Logging implementation is fragmented and needs unification

## Implementation Strategy

### Current Priority Tasks

Based on current progress and the original priority list, these are the next tasks to focus on:

1. Complete Account Lockout Enhancement (implement admin notifications for high-risk accounts)
2. Enhance Role-Based Access Control (improve fine-grained permissions)
3. Finish Session Management implementation (suspicious activity detection)
4. Improve Security Audit Logging (unified interface and exportable reports)

### Future Priority Tasks

After completing the current priority tasks, these should be addressed next:

1. Password Strength Indicators
2. Remember Me Functionality
3. Social Authentication
4. Forgotten User Experience
