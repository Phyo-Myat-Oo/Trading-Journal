# Security Tasks Implementation Progress

This document tracks the progress of implementing security features as defined in the SECURITY_TASKS_TODO.md file.

## Recently Completed Tasks

### 1. Token Refresh Mechanism ✅

**Status**: Fully Implemented

**Completed Tasks:**
- ✅ Completed the token refresh interceptor in `api.ts`
- ✅ Implemented the `TokenManager` functionality for token refreshing
- ✅ Added proper error handling for expired tokens
- ✅ Implemented automatic token refresh before expiration
- ✅ Integrated token refresh mechanism in the authentication flow

The TokenManager now properly handles token lifecycle, proactive refreshing, error handling, and cross-tab synchronization. It uses an event-based system to communicate token states across the application.

### 11. CSRF Protection ✅

**Status**: Fully Implemented

**Completed Tasks:**
- ✅ Ensured CSRF protection for all authenticated requests
- ✅ Implemented CSRF token validation in the frontend
- ✅ Added proper error handling for CSRF failures
- ✅ Implemented automatic CSRF token renewal
- ✅ Added comprehensive tests for CSRF protection

The CSRFManager now properly handles CSRF token lifecycle, automatic renewal, and cross-tab synchronization.

### 3. JWT Token Expiration Handling ✅

**Status**: Fully Implemented

**Completed Tasks:**
- ✅ Set appropriate expiration times for both access and refresh tokens
- ✅ Implemented proper expiration handling on the frontend
- ✅ Added graceful handling of expired tokens during user sessions
- ✅ Ensured token validation includes proper expiration checks
- ✅ Added clear user feedback when a session expires

The system now supports dynamic token expiration based on device type, user activity, and "Remember Me" preference. It also includes a user-friendly session expiration dialog with countdown timer and one-click extension.

### Password Reset Bug Fix ✅

**Status**: Fixed

**Bug Details:**
There was a mismatch between how the password reset token was generated and stored. In the `requestPasswordReset` function, a JWT token was being sent to the user's email, but there was no code to properly store this JWT in the user's `resetPasswordToken` field.

**Implementation:**
- ✅ Fixed the `requestPasswordReset` function in `authController.ts` to properly store the JWT token in the user document
- ✅ Set an appropriate expiration time in the user document that matches the JWT expiration
- ✅ Added proper TypeScript typing for error objects with response properties in the API service
- ✅ Ensured consistent error handling between frontend and backend

This fix ensures that password reset tokens work correctly, and users can successfully reset their passwords using the email links.

### 5. Email Verification ✅

**Status**: Fully Implemented

**Completed Tasks:**
- ✅ Complete email verification for new user registrations
- ✅ Add proper email templates for verification messages
- ✅ Implement verification token expiration and renewal
- ✅ Add clear user interface for verification status
- ✅ Prevent certain actions until email is verified

The system now includes a fully functioning email verification flow with:
- An enhanced `EmailVerificationBanner` component that appears when a user needs to verify their email
- A dedicated `VerifyEmail` page with clear success/error feedback and countdown redirect
- The ability to resend verification emails directly from the login page
- Proper handling of verification status in the authentication process
- Backend support for token verification and renewal
- Error handling for invalid or expired verification tokens

## In Progress Tasks

### 4. Account Lockout Enhancement

**Status**: Partially Implemented

Basic lockout is implemented, but progressive lockout and admin tools are needed.

### 12. Security Headers

**Status**: Partially Implemented

Basic security headers are set with Helmet, but Content-Security-Policy and other advanced headers need configuration.

## Next Priority Tasks

The following tasks are the next priorities based on the defined order:
