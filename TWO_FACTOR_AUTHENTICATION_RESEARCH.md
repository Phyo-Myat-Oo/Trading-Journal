# Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Research Document

## Current Implementation Status

The Trading Journal application has a **partially implemented backend for 2FA**, but the frontend implementation is **completely missing**. This creates a mismatch where the backend code exists but users cannot actually use the feature.

### Backend Implementation

1. **User Model Support**:
   - The `User` model includes fields for 2FA:
     - `twoFactorEnabled` (boolean)
     - `twoFactorSecret` (string)
     - `twoFactorBackupCodes` (string array)
     - `twoFactorTempSecret` (string)

2. **Controllers**:
   - `twoFactorController.ts` contains comprehensive functionality:
     - `verifyTwoFactorLogin`: Verifies a TOTP code during login
     - `verifyBackupCode`: Allows login with a backup code
     - `setupTwoFactor`: Initiates 2FA setup for a user
     - `verifyAndEnableTwoFactor`: Finalizes 2FA setup after verification
     - `disableTwoFactor`: Removes 2FA from a user account

3. **Services**:
   - `twoFactorService.ts` includes utility functions:
     - Secret generation with TOTP standards
     - QR code generation for authenticator apps
     - Token verification
     - Backup code generation and verification

4. **API Routes**:
   - Auth routes (`/api/auth/2fa/*`):
     - `/2fa/verify`: For verifying a TOTP code during login
     - `/2fa/backup`: For using a backup code during login
   - User routes (`/api/users/2fa/*`):
     - `/2fa/setup`: For initiating 2FA setup
     - `/2fa/verify`: For enabling 2FA after verification
     - `/2fa/disable`: For disabling 2FA

5. **Authentication Flow**:
   - The login controller (`authController.ts`) checks for 2FA:
     ```javascript
     // Check if 2FA is enabled
     if (user.twoFactorEnabled) {
       // User has 2FA enabled, don't generate tokens yet
       // Just update last login and return user info for 2FA step
       return res.json({
         message: 'Password verification successful, 2FA verification required',
         requireTwoFactor: true,
         userId: user._id
       });
     }
     ```

6. **Required Packages**:
   - The backend has the necessary packages installed:
     - `speakeasy` (v2.0.0): For TOTP generation and verification
     - `qrcode` (v1.5.4): For generating QR codes for authenticator apps
     - Type definitions for both packages are also installed

### Missing Frontend Implementation

Despite the backend implementation, there are **no frontend components** for managing or using 2FA:

1. **No 2FA Login Flow**:
   - Login.tsx does not handle `requireTwoFactor` response
   - No UI to input a verification code during login
   - No option to use backup codes

2. **No Account Management**:
   - No UI to set up 2FA
   - No UI to view or manage backup codes
   - No UI to disable 2FA

3. **No AuthContext Integration**:
   - AuthContext.tsx does not handle 2FA states
   - No service method to verify 2FA codes

4. **No Frontend Packages**:
   - No equivalent to `speakeasy` or similar OTP libraries for the frontend
   - No QR code rendering components installed

## Implementation Requirements

To complete the 2FA functionality, the following components need to be implemented:

### Frontend Components Needed

1. **Two-Factor Authentication Setup**:
   - QR code display component
   - Verification code input
   - Backup codes display and management
   - Success/failure states

2. **Two-Factor Login Flow**:
   - Detection of 2FA requirements in login response
   - Verification code input screen
   - Option to use backup codes
   - Error handling

3. **Account Security Settings**:
   - Enable/disable 2FA toggle
   - Regenerate backup codes option
   - Display current 2FA status

### Service Layer Modifications

1. **Auth Service Extensions**:
   - Methods for 2FA verification during login
   - Methods for backup code verification
   - Methods for 2FA setup and management

2. **AuthContext Updates**:
   - Handle 2FA verification state
   - Store and manage 2FA setup flow

### Required Frontend Packages

To implement the frontend components, the following packages would be needed:
   - `react-qr-code`: For displaying QR codes on the frontend
   - UI components for code input (could be custom or use existing input components)
   - Possible timer component for showing TOTP code validity period

## Conclusion

The Trading Journal application has a robust backend implementation for two-factor authentication, using industry standards like TOTP and backup codes. However, the feature is not usable because the frontend implementation is completely missing.

To activate this security feature, a comprehensive frontend implementation needs to be developed that integrates with the existing backend endpoints. This would significantly enhance the security posture of the application by adding a second layer of authentication beyond passwords.
