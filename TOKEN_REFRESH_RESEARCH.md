# Token Refresh Mechanism Research

## Current Implementation Status

The codebase has a partially implemented token refresh mechanism with the following components:

### Backend Implementation

1. **Token Service (`backend/src/services/tokenService.ts`)**:
   - Has methods for generating both access and refresh tokens
   - Implements `generateRefreshToken()` which creates and stores a refresh token
   - Has `verifyRefreshToken()` to validate refresh tokens with security checks
   - Supports token family tracking to detect token reuse
   - Implements token expiration settings and verification

2. **Auth Controller (`backend/src/controllers/authController.ts`)**:
   - Has a fully implemented `/refresh-token` endpoint
   - Handles refresh token retrieval from cookies
   - Implements token rotation (issuing a new refresh token when used)
   - Includes enhanced security checks
   - Returns a new access token when successful

3. **Authentication Middleware (`backend/src/middleware/authMiddleware.ts`)**:
   - Verifies JWT tokens for protected routes
   - Validates token type, audience, and expiration
   - Checks if tokens have been blacklisted/revoked

### Frontend Implementation

1. **TokenManager Service (`frontend/src/services/TokenManager.ts`)**:
   - Class for managing token refresh with a singleton pattern
   - Implements methods for token validation and refresh scheduling
   - Has queueing mechanism for refresh requests
   - Includes error handling and retry logic
   - Uses an event emitter pattern for notifications
   - **Status**: Partially implemented but not fully integrated

2. **API Interceptors (`frontend/src/utils/api.ts`)**:
   - Has interceptors for request and response handling
   - Contains logic to detect token expiration
   - Has code to refresh tokens when expired
   - Contains retry logic for failed requests after token refresh
   - **Status**: Code is present but commented out or not fully functional

3. **Auth Service (`frontend/src/services/authService.ts`)**:
   - Implements `refreshToken()` function
   - Has token validity checks
   - Implements token storage and retrieval
   - Has subscriber pattern for token refresh notifications
   - **Status**: Implementation exists but not properly integrated with TokenManager

4. **Auth Context (`frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)**:
   - Uses a periodic token refresh check (every 5 minutes)
   - Has network status detection to handle offline/online transitions
   - Maintains authentication state based on token validity
   - **Status**: Basic implementation exists but not optimized

## Issues with Current Implementation

1. **Integration Issues**:
   - TokenManager exists but isn't fully utilized by the API interceptors
   - Multiple parallel implementations (in AuthService and TokenManager)
   - Lack of clear ownership between components

2. **Token Refresh Timing**:
   - Current implementation uses fixed intervals rather than token lifetime-based refreshing
   - Does not proactively refresh tokens before they expire

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Insufficient error recovery for network failures
   - Limited retry logic with proper backoff

4. **Security Concerns**:
   - Token rotation is implemented but not consistently applied
   - Missing proper revocation of compromised tokens

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Complete TokenManager Integration**:
   - Finalize the TokenManager implementation
   - Ensure proper event handling and notifications
   - Implement proper error handling with retries

2. **Finalize API Interceptors**:
   - Uncomment and refine token refresh code in API interceptors
   - Ensure proper integration with TokenManager
   - Implement robust error handling for network failures

3. **Optimize Refresh Strategy**:
   - Implement token refresh based on token lifetime percentage (refresh at 75% of lifetime)
   - Add proactive refresh for soon-to-expire tokens
   - Implement proper backoff strategy for failed refreshes

4. **Enhance Security**:
   - Ensure proper token rotation
   - Implement token revocation on logout
   - Add additional security checks for token theft detection

5. **Improve User Experience**:
   - Add graceful handling of token expiration during user sessions
   - Implement seamless background refresh without disrupting the user
   - Add clear feedback when authentication issues occur

## Implementation Approach

1. **First Phase**:
   - Finalize the TokenManager implementation
   - Complete the integration with API interceptors
   - Test basic token refresh functionality

2. **Second Phase**:
   - Enhance security features
   - Implement optimized refresh strategy
   - Add comprehensive error handling

3. **Third Phase**:
   - Improve user experience
   - Add comprehensive logging
   - Perform thorough testing across different scenarios
   - Document the implementation for future reference

## Key Files to Modify

1. `frontend/src/utils/api.ts` - Complete the token refresh interceptors
2. `frontend/src/services/TokenManager.ts` - Finalize implementation and integration
3. `frontend/src/services/authService.ts` - Ensure proper integration with TokenManager
4. `frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Update refresh strategy and error handling
