# Token Refresh Mechanism

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the token refresh mechanism in the application. The token refresh mechanism ensures that the user's authentication token is refreshed before it expires, providing a seamless authentication experience.

## Components

The token refresh mechanism consists of several components:

1. **TokenManager**: A singleton class that manages token state, refreshing, and events.
2. **AuthService**: Handles authentication-related API calls and integrates with TokenManager.
3. **AuthContext**: Provides authentication state and methods to React components.
4. **API Interceptors**: Handles token expiration and refreshing in API calls.

## TokenManager

The `TokenManager` class is the central component of the token refresh mechanism. It is responsible for:

- Managing token state (valid, expiring, expired, refreshing, etc.)
- Refreshing tokens before they expire
- Emitting events when token state changes
- Implementing a circuit breaker pattern to prevent excessive refresh attempts
- Queuing refresh requests to avoid concurrent refreshes

### Key Features

- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures only one instance of TokenManager exists.
- **Event-Based Architecture**: Uses an event emitter to notify subscribers of token state changes.
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Prevents excessive refresh attempts when the server is unavailable.
- **Queue Management**: Handles multiple refresh requests efficiently.
- **State Management**: Tracks token state and transitions.
- **Resilience**: Handles various error scenarios gracefully.
- **Security Checks**: Detects suspicious patterns and prevents abuse.

## Integration with AuthService

The `authService` integrates with TokenManager to:

- Initialize TokenManager during auth initialization
- Delegate token refreshing to TokenManager
- Update user data based on token information
- Handle token-related errors

## Integration with AuthContext

The `AuthContext` uses TokenManager to:

- Listen for token events
- Update authentication state based on token events
- Handle token expiration and refresh failures
- Provide a consistent authentication state to the application

## Integration with API Interceptors

The API interceptors integrate with TokenManager to:

- Add authentication tokens to requests
- Handle 401 errors by refreshing tokens
- Queue requests during token refresh
- Retry requests with new tokens after successful refresh

## Token Flow

1. **Initialization**:
   - During app startup, `initializeAuth` is called
   - Existing token is validated and TokenManager is initialized
   - If token is valid but expiring soon, a refresh is triggered

2. **Token Expiration**:
   - TokenManager monitors token expiration
   - When a token is about to expire, a `TOKEN_EXPIRING` event is emitted
   - AuthContext listens for this event and triggers a refresh

3. **Token Refresh**:
   - AuthService delegates refresh to TokenManager
   - TokenManager sends a refresh request to the server
   - On success, a `TOKEN_REFRESH` event is emitted
   - All subscribers are notified of the new token

4. **Error Handling**:
   - If refresh fails, TokenManager emits a `TOKEN_ERROR` event
   - Circuit breaker may be tripped to prevent excessive refresh attempts
   - AuthContext handles errors and may log out the user if necessary

## Security Considerations

- Token state is managed securely
- Refresh requests are protected against excessive attempts
- Suspicious patterns are detected and prevented
- Circuit breaker pattern prevents abuse during service outages

## Offline Support

- Token validation considers network status
- Refresh attempts are queued when offline
- Authentication state is preserved during brief network outages

## Future Improvements

- Enhanced monitoring and logging of token lifecycle
- More sophisticated circuit breaker logic
- Improved offline support with token caching
- Better handling of multi-tab scenarios
