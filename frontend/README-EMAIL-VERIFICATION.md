# Email Verification System

This document outlines the email verification features implemented in the Trading Journal application.

## Overview

Email verification is a critical security feature that ensures users have access to the email address they register with. It helps:

- Prevent account creation using other people's email addresses
- Ensure communication channels are valid 
- Reduce spam and fraudulent accounts
- Improve overall platform security

## Flow

1. **Registration**: When a user registers, their account is created but marked as unverified.
2. **Verification Email**: A verification email with a unique token is sent to the user's email address.
3. **User Action**: The user clicks the link in the email, which contains the verification token.
4. **Verification**: The system validates the token and marks the user's account as verified.
5. **Access**: The user now has full access to the platform's features.

## Components

### Backend Components

- `verifyEmail` controller: Processes email verification tokens
- `resendVerification` controller: Handles resending verification emails
- JWT-based verification tokens with 24-hour expiration
- User model with `isVerified` flag

### Frontend Components

- `VerifyEmail` page: Processes verification links and displays confirmation
- `EmailVerificationBanner`: Displays in the Login page for unverified users
- `EmailVerificationStatus`: Shows verification status in user settings
- Email verification status in the user profile section

## User Experience

### Login Flow

When an unverified user attempts to login:
1. Login is processed, but an "email verification required" message is shown
2. The `EmailVerificationBanner` is displayed, informing the user of the verification requirement
3. User can request a new verification email via the banner

### Verification Page

When a user clicks the verification link:
1. The `VerifyEmail` page shows a loading indicator
2. Upon successful verification:
   - Success confirmation is displayed
   - A countdown starts for redirect to the login page
   - Clear next steps are provided
3. If verification fails:
   - Error message explains the issue (expired, invalid, etc.)
   - Option to request a new verification email is provided

### Account Settings

The user's verification status is displayed prominently in their account settings:
1. A green confirmation if verified
2. An amber warning if not verified, with option to resend verification email

## Implementation Notes

- Verification tokens are JWT-based with a 24-hour expiration
- For security, the API doesn't reveal if an email exists in the system when requesting verification
- Both backend and frontend validation ensure verification tokens are valid
- The system handles cases where a user tries to verify an already verified account

## Future Enhancements

- Email change verification (require verification of new email before switching)
- Administrative tools to manually verify accounts when needed
- Analytics on verification success/failure rates
- Expire unverified accounts after a set time period
