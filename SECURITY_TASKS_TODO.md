Now I'll conduct a detailed analysis of each security feature and its implementation status:

[MODE: RESEARCH]

Based on my research of the codebase, here's a detailed analysis of the security features you asked about:

## 1. Account Lockout Enhancement

**Status: Mostly Completed (80-90%)**

The account lockout mechanism is well-implemented with progressive lockout functionality:

* **Progressive Lockout**: Implemented with increasing durations based on previous lockouts:
  - First lockout: 15 minutes
  - Second lockout: 30 minutes
  - Third+ lockout: 60 minutes
  - After 3+ lockouts: Admin intervention required

* **Admin Interface**: Comprehensive tools for managing locked accounts:
  - Admin panel shows locked accounts with detailed information
  - Admins can unlock accounts and reset lockout history
  - Account status badges indicate lockout severity

* **Security Notifications**: Email notifications for account lockouts are implemented

* **Testing**: Thorough testing code exists for progressive lockout functionality

**What's missing/incomplete**:
- The admin notification system for high-risk accounts could be enhanced
- Some documentation suggests custom lockout timeframes were planned but not fully implemented

## 2. Security Headers

**Status: Completed (95-100%)**

The security headers implementation is very comprehensive:

* **Helmet Integration**: Properly configured with customized settings
* **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Fully implemented with:
  - Environment-specific configurations (development vs. production)
  - Reporting endpoint for CSP violations
  - Comprehensive directive configuration

* **Advanced Headers**: Implementation includes:
  - Permissions-Policy (formerly Feature-Policy)
  - Cross-Origin Resource Policy (CORP)
  - Cross-Origin Opener Policy (COOP)
  - Cross-Origin Embedder Policy (COEP)
  - Referrer-Policy
  - X-XSS-Protection

* **CSP Violation Reporting**: Logging mechanism for CSP violations is implemented

**What's missing/incomplete**:
- Minor configuration adjustments might be needed for specific deployment environments
- Documentation suggests some headers might need fine-tuning

## 3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Status: Mostly Completed (75-85%)**

RBAC implementation is substantial but has some gaps:

* **Backend Authorization**: Well-implemented with:
  - `authorize` middleware for role-based route protection
  - Role checking in controllers
  - Protected routes with role requirements

* **Frontend Implementation**:
  - `RoleBasedRoute` component for route protection
  - `useAuthorization` hook for permission checking
  - `RoleBasedPermissions` component for conditional rendering

* **Admin Routes**: Protected with proper role checks

**What's missing/incomplete**:
- According to TODO docs, the `useAuthorization` hook needs more fine-grained permission checks
- Some role-specific route protection may need enhancement
- Permission-based UI rendering could be more consistently applied across the application

## 4. Session Management

**Status: Mostly Completed (70-80%)**

Session management features are partially implemented:

* **Active Sessions View**: The `SessionsManagement` component shows:
  - List of all active sessions with device details
  - Current session identification
  - Ability to terminate individual sessions
  - Session refresh functionality

* **Backend Support**:
  - API endpoints for fetching and terminating sessions
  - Token family tracking
  - Session creation and expiration handling

**What's missing/incomplete**:
- Enhanced session tracking with more detailed device/location information
- Detection for suspicious session activity could be improved
- Documentation indicates some planned enhancements haven't been completed

## 5. Security Audit Logging

**Status: Partially Completed (60-70%)**

Security audit logging has several components implemented:

* **Token Event Logging**: Comprehensive logging for token-related events:
  - Suspicious token usage
  - Token revocation
  - Refresh attempts

* **Admin Activity Logging**: Tracks admin actions:
  - Account management
  - User unlocking
  - Administrative changes

* **Basic Security Event Logging**: 
  - Failed login attempts
  - Rate limit violations
  - CSP violations

**What's missing/incomplete**:
- Admin interface for viewing comprehensive security logs needs enhancement
- Exportable reports functionality is either missing or incomplete
- Advanced filtering and searching of security logs is not fully implemented
- The logging implementation appears fragmented across different parts of the system rather than unified

Overall, the project has made significant progress on security features, with Account Lockout and Security Headers being the most complete, while Session Management and Security Audit Logging need more work to fully implement the intended functionality.
